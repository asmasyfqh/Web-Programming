# Web Programming Class Activities Compilation
This repo is where I archive my completed assignments during my degree for the course Introduction to Web Programming. 
Here are the list to summarize what I have learned:
  - Create a website using drag-and-drop tools such as Wix to be familiar with website development environment. We were asked to build an online portfolio to compile all of our class activities. Here is the [link to my wixsite](https://asmaasyfqh.wixsite.com/portfolio58486) 
  - learned essential web programming languages such as HTML and CSS
  - learned how to make basic database website using HTML, PHP, and SQL. I created  a Group Tour Registration website for the assignment.
  - create an infographic poster to explain how CSS can help human cognition. For this assignment, I used Canva to create the poster.

The end.
